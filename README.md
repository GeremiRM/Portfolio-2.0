# Portfolio
This is the third iteration of my portfolio. 

I've made use of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which is a production grade React framework.

This app leverages Next's SSR capabilities to statically fetch and render all its data. Everything from What I'm Doing to Projects and the Skill chips are fetched from JSON files and pre-rendered.
